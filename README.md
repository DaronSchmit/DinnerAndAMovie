## Description

With this app a user is able to search a movie and it will automatically pick a meal to match, including the recipe to that meal!

## User's Needs/Expectations

The user, a movie and food enthusiast, wants to a meal recommendation based on the movie input in order to make a quick decision in a fun experience. The app must also allow the user to "like" their searched movie and dinner. The liked pairings are required to viewable on a history page the is rendered using handlebars and is retrieving data from the Sequelized MySQL database.

- The movie and dinner recommendation application must allow the user to search for the movie info by their
  name.
- The meal recommendation must load on search of a movie title and present the name of the meal recommendation, image and recipe of the meal.
- The app will be served by Heroku and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS and Handlebars powered by JQuery.
- Axios calls to the OMDb API is used to retrieve data for movies and TheMealDB API is employed to generate meal recommendations.
- The user's searched movie and dinner recommendation can be "liked" which saves the data to the movie and dinner tables. Then the liked parings
  will be retrived from the tabales using a join on the dinnerId and rendered to the history page with handlebars.

## Installation

1. Create a folder which will contain our app and within it type the following command to create the JSON file containing all the information and dependencies:
2. Use the command-line, npm i, to install Express, Express-Handlebars, and mysql npm.
3. Now we create our main js file which will contain our application's logic and name it "index.js"
4. To start creating movie and dinner pairing, using Express, use the command, node server.js and navigate in the
   web browser to localhost:8080.
5. Finally, let's create a folder by the name of "public" in which we create a .css file and let's call it "style.css".

## Usage

- Express and Heroku and used to serve and display to the the user Handlebars HTML templated info of their searched and
  favorited dinner and a movie pairings.
- Handlebars is used to render the HTML.
- Once the user's information regarding:
  - searched movie is inputed into the input box:
- A Handlebars file with the user's added movie and dinner along with their unique id is created.

## Test

Use the seed data and the schema file to create and test a local version of the deployed database. Test the different api pages/routes using Postman, to ensure that the data is saving and the Sequelized MySQL
database is accessed.

## Deployed

Overall Deployment of Dinner and a Movie

On load of page: a search input and search button are present to enter a movie name in order to obtain its information using an Axios call to the OMDb API.

When the user inputs the movie name into the text box and clicks the search button, event listeners and functions are triggered for:

The movie name inputed into the text box.
A first Axios call is made to the OMDb API to obtain the movie poster and descritption.
The last Axios call is made to TheMealDB using the first leter of the movie title from the first call to obtain a meal recommendation.

Math.floor(Math.random()) is used with the first letter of the response from the OMDb API passed to the TheMealDB to create a randomized meal recommendation.

When the user clicks the like button for the retrieved movie and meal, then the movie is saved to the movie database and the dinner is saved to the dinner database.

The liked pairings are are viewable on a history page the is rendered using handlebars and is retrieving data from the Sequelized MySQL database by joining the tables on the movieId.
